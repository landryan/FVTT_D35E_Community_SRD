# FVTT_D35E_Community_SRD
A community-managed SRD for the DnD 3.5 System for Foundry VTT.

## Pre-Requisites:

- Sorry only works for **Windows** at present
- Smelter - https://github.com/Muttley/smelter
- GIT for Windows (to submit changes back to GIT Hub)

## Configuration

- Make sure the paths.cfg file is amended to reflect the paths to NodeJs, Smelter and your D35E packs directory.

### Import the SRD as is

- Run Import_to_LevelDB.bat - this will overwrite the default system compendiums with the contents of the SRD directory of this repo.

### Changing things

- Add your own enhancements using Method A or B.
- You can "edit via GUI then export" (Method A) or "export then edit via Text Editor and re-import " (Method B).
- Submissions via Pull Request (requires GIT)
- Only SRD submissions covered by the Open Gaming Licence will be considered for approval. **NO COPYRIGHT BREACHES**.

0. Probably best to create a branch and switch to it

4. copy it to the SRD folder, overwriting the out-the-box version
