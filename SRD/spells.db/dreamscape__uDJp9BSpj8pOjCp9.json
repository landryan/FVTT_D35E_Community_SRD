The character does not know precisely where he or she will come out in the waking world, nor the conditions of the waking world through which the character travels. The character knows approximately where he or she will end up based on time spent traveling in dream. <i>Dreamscape</i> can also be used to travel to other planes that contain creatures that dream, but doing this requires crossing into the dreams of Outsiders, where the character is subject to the dangers of alien dream realities. This is a potentially perilous proposition. Transferring to another plane of existence requires 1d4 hours of uninterrupted journey. Any creatures touched by the character when <i>dreamscape</i> is cast also make the transition to the borders of unconscious thought.
