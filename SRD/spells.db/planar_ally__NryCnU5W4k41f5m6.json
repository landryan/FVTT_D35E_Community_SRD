If you serve no particular deity, the spell is a general plea answered by a creature sharing your philosophical alignment. If you know an individual creature&rsquo;s name, you may request that individual by speaking the name during the spell (though you might get a different creature anyway).</p>\n<p>You may ask the creature to perform one task in exchange for a payment from you. Tasks might range from the simple to the complex. You must be able to communicate with the creature called in order to bargain for its services. The creatures agree to help you and request your return payment together.</p>\n<p>The creature called requires a payment for its services. This payment can take a variety of forms, from donating gold or magic items to an allied temple, to a gift given directly to the creature, to some other action on your part that matches the creature&rsquo;s alignment and goals. Regardless, this payment must be made before the creature agrees to perform any services. The bargaining takes at least 1 round, so any actions by the creature begin in the round after it arrives.</p>\n<p>A task taking up to 1 minute per caster level requires a payment of 100 gp per HD of the creature called.

A long-term task, one requiring up to one day per caster level, requires a payment of 1,000 gp per HD.</p>\n<p>A nonhazardous task requires only half the indicated payment, while an especially hazardous task might require a greater gift. Few if any creatures will accept a task that seems suicidal (remember, a called creature actually dies when it is killed, unlike a summoned creature).
