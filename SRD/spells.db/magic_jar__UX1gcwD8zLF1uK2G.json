You do need line of effect from the jar to the creatures. You cannot determine the exact creature types or positions of these creatures. In a group of life forces, you can sense a difference of 4 or more Hit Dice between one creature and another and can determine whether a life force is powered by positive or negative energy.

The body retains its Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, hit points, natural abilities, and automatic abilities. A body with extra limbs does not allow you to make more attacks (or more advantageous two-weapon attacks) than normal. You can’t choose to activate the body’s extraordinary or supernatural abilities. The creature’s spells and spell-like abilities do not stay with the body.\n</p><p>As a standard action, you can shift freely from a host to the <i>magic jar </i>if within range, sending the trapped soul back to its body. The spell ends when you shift from the jar to your own body.\n</p><p>If the host body is slain, you return to the <i>magic jar, </i>if within range, and the life force of the host departs (it is dead). If the host body is slain beyond the range of the spell, both you and the host die.

If the spell ends while you are in a host, you return to your body (or die, if it is out of range of your current position), and the soul in the <i>magic jar </i>returns to its body (or dies if it is out of range).
