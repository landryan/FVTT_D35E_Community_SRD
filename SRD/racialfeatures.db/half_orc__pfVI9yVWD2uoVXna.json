			"value": "These orc–human crossbreeds can be found in either orc or human society (where their status varies according to local sentiments), or in communities of their own. Half-orcs usually inherit a good blend of the physical characteristics of their parents. They are as tall as humans and a little heavier, thanks to their muscle. They have greenish pigmentation, sloping foreheads, jutting jaws, prominent teeth, and coarse body hair. Half-orcs who have lived among or near orcs have scars, in keeping with orcish tradition.\n<ul>\n<li>+2 Strength, –2 Intelligence, –2 Charisma.\n<li>A half-orc’s starting Intelligence score is always at least 3. If this adjustment would lower the character’s score to 1 or 2, his score is nevertheless 3.\n<li>Humanoid (Orc).\n<li>Medium: As Medium creatures, half-orcs have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.\n<li>Half-orc base land speed is 30 feet.\n<li>Darkvision: Half-orcs (and orcs) can see in the dark up to 60 feet. Darkvision is black and white only, but it is otherwise like normal sight, and half-orcs can function just fine with no light at all.\n<li>Orc Blood: For all effects related to race, a half-orc is considered an orc.\n<li>Automatic Languages: Common and Orc. Bonus Languages: Draconic, Giant, Gnoll, Goblin, and Abyssal.\n<li>Favored Class: Barbarian. A multiclass half-orc’s barbarian class does not count when determining whether he takes an experience point penalty.\n<li>Level Adjustment: +0.\n</ul>"
