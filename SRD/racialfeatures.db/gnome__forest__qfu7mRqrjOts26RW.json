A very long-lived people, forest gnomes have an average life expectancy of 500 years.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>+2 Constitution, &ndash;2 Strength.</li>\n<li>Humanoid (Gnome)</li>\n<li>Small: As a Small creature, a forest gnome gains a +1 size bonus to Armor Class, a +1 size bonus on attack rolls, and a +4 size bonus on Hide checks, but he uses smaller weapons than humans use, and his lifting and carrying limits are three-quarters of those of a Medium character.</li>\n<li>Forest gnome base land speed is 20 feet.</li>\n<li>Low-Light Vision: A forest gnome can see twice as far as a human in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of poor illumination. He retains the ability to distinguish color and detail under these conditions.</li>\n<li>Weapon Familiarity: Forest gnomes may treat gnome hooked hammers as martial weapons rather than exotic weapons.</li>\n<li>Pass without Trace (Su): A forest gnome has the innate ability to use pass without trace (self only, as a free action) as the spell cast by a druid of the forest gnome&rsquo;s class levels.</li>\n<li>+2 racial bonus on saving throws against illusions.</li>\n<li>Add +1 to the Difficulty Class for all saving throws against illusion spells cast by forest gnomes. This adjustment stacks with those from similar effects.</li>\n<li>+1 racial bonus on attack rolls against goblinoids, orcs, and reptilian humanoids.</li>\n<li>+4 dodge bonus to Armor Class against monsters of the giant type. Any time a creature loses its Dexterity bonus (if any) to Armor Class, such as when it&rsquo;s caught flat-footed, it loses its dodge bonus, too.</li>\n<li>+2 racial bonus on Listen checks.</li>\n<li>+2 racial bonus on Craft (alchemy) checks.</li>\n<li>+4 racial bonus on Hide checks, which improves to +8 in a wooded area.</li>\n<li>Automatic Languages: Gnome, Elven, Sylvan, and a simple language that enables them to communicate on a very basic level with forest animals. Bonus Languages: Common, Draconic, Dwarven, Giant, Goblin, Orc.</li>\n<li>Spell-Like Abilities: A forest gnome with a Charisma score of at least 10 has the following spell-like abilities: 1/day&mdash;dancing lights, ghost sound, prestidigitation.
