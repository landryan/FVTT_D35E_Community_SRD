He retains the ability to distinguish color and detail under these conditions.</li>\n<li>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: A half-giant is automatically proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light and medium armor, and shields.</li>\n<li>Fire Acclimated: Half-giants have a +2 racial bonus on saving throws against all fire spells and effects. Half-giants are accustomed to enduring high temperatures.</li>\n<li>Powerful Build: The physical stature of half-giants lets them function in many ways as if they were one size category larger. Whenever a half-giant is subject to a size modifier or special size modifier for an opposed check (such as during grapple checks, bull rush attempts, and trip attempts), the half-giant is treated as one size larger if doing so is advantageous to him. A half-giant is also considered to be one size larger when determining whether a creature&rsquo;s special attacks based on size (such as improved grab or swallow whole) can affect him. A half-giant can use weapons designed for a creature one size larger without penalty. However, his space and reach remain those of a creature of his actual size. The benefits of this racial trait stack with the effects of powers, abilities, and spells that change the subject&rsquo;s size category.</li>\n<li>Naturally Psionic: Half-giants gain 2 bonus power points at 1st level. This benefit does not grant them the ability to manifest powers unless they gain that ability through another source, such as levels in a psionic class.</li>\n<li>Psi-Like Ability: 1/day&mdash;stomp. Manifester level is equal to 1/2 Hit Dice (minimum 1st). The save DC is Charisma-based.</li>\n<li>Automatic Language: Common. Bonus Languages: Draconic, Giant, Gnoll, Ignan.</li>\n<li>Favored Class: Psychic warrior.</li>\n<li>Level Adjustment: +1.</li>\n</ul>"
