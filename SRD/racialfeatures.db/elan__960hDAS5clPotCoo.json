This benefit does not grant them the ability to manifest powers unless they gain that ability through another source, such as levels in a psionic class.</li>\n<li>Resistance (Su): Elans can use psionic energy to increase their resistance to various forms of attack. As an immediate action, an elan can spend 1 power point to gain a +4 racial bonus on saving throws until the beginning of her next action.</li>\n<li>Resilience (Su): When an elan takes damage, she can spend power points to reduce its severity. As an immediate action, she can reduce the damage she is about to take by 2 hit points for every 1 power point she spends.</li>\n<li>Repletion (Su): An elan can sustain her body without need of food or water. If she spends 1 power point, an elan does not need to eat or drink for 24 hours.</li>\n<li>Automatic Language: Common. Bonus Languages: Any (other than secret languages, such as Druidic). Elans&rsquo; past lives expose them to wide ranges of language.</li>\n<li>Favored Class: Psion.</li>\n<li>Level Adjustment: +0.</li>\n</ul>"
