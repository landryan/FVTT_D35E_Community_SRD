Some powers, as detailed in their descriptions, can&rsquo;t be defeated by <em>dispel psionics, </em>or can be ended only if you manifest <em>dispel psionics </em>at a high enough manifester level. <em>Dispel psionics </em>can end spell-like effects just as it does powers.</p>\n<p>The effect of a power with an instantaneous duration can&rsquo;t be dispelled, because the psionic effect is already over before the <em>dispel psionics </em>can take effect.</p>\n<p>You choose to use <em>dispel psionics </em>in one of two ways: a targeted dispel or an area dispel.</p>\n<p><em>Targeted Dispel: </em>One object, creature, or power is the target of the <em>dispel psionics </em>power. You make a dispel check (1d20 + your manifester level, maximum +10) against the power or against each ongoing power currently in effect on the object or creature. The DC for this dispel check is 11 + the power&rsquo;s manifester level. If you succeed on a particular check, that power is dispelled; if you fail, that power remains in effect.</p>\n<p>If you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing power or is under the effect of an ongoing power, you make a dispel check to end the power or its effect. If the object that you target is a psionic item, you make a dispel check against the item&rsquo;s manifester level. If you succeed, all the item&rsquo;s psionic properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers on its own. A suppressed item becomes nonpsionic for the duration of the effect. An interdimensional interface is temporarily closed. A psionic item&rsquo;s physical properties are unchanged: A suppressed psionic sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact).

If that check fails, you make dispel checks against progressively weaker powers until you dispel one power (which discharges the <em>dispel psionics </em>power so far as that target is concerned) or until you fail all your checks.
