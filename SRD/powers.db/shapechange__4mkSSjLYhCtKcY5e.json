Physical abilities include natural size and Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores Natural abilities include armor, natural weapons (not supernatural abilities), and similar gross physical qualities. The character also gains the extraordinary abilities of the new form. A body with extra limbs does not allow a character to make more attacks (or more advantageous two-weapon attacks) than normal. Natural abilities also include mundane movement capabilities, such as walking, swimming, and flight with wings, but not psionic or magical flight and other psionic or magical forms of travel. Extremely high speeds for certain creatures are the result of extraordinary magical, or psionic ability, so they are not granted by this power. (In general, non-flying speeds greater than 60 and flying speeds greater that 120.) Other mundane abilities (such as low-light vision) are considered natural abilities and are retained.\n</p><p>Any part of the body or piece of equipment that is separated from the whole does not revert to its original form, thus a creature's poison is effective.\n</p><p>The character's new scores and faculties are average ones for the race or species into which he or she has been transformed. The character cannot transform into an exceptional or templated creature. The character gains the new form's type in place of his or her own.\n</p><p>The character retains his or her Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, level and class, hit points (despite any change to Constitution score), alignment, base attack bonus, and base saves. (New Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores may affect final attack and save bonuses, as well as the DCs for affected powers.) The character retains his or her own extraordinary abilities, psionics, spells, and spell-like abilities, but not supernatural abilities.\n</p><p>The character does not gain the supernatural abilities of the new creature.\n</p><p>When the polymorph occurs, the character's equipment, if any, transforms to match the new form. If the new form is a creature who does not use equipment (aberration, animal, beast, magical beast, construct, dragon, elemental, ooze, some outsiders, plant, some undead creatures, some shapechangers, or vermin), the equipment melds into the new form and becomes nonfunctional. If the new form uses equipment (fey, giant, humanoid, some outsiders, many shapechangers, many undead creatures), the equipment changes to match the new form and retains its properties.\n</p><p>The character can freely designate the new form's minor physical qualities within the normal ranges for a creature of that type. The new form's significant physical qualities are also under the character's control, but must fall within the norms for the new form's species.\n</p><p>The character is effectively disguised as an average member of the new form's race. If the character uses this power to create a disguise, he or she gets a +10 bonus on his or her Disguise check.\n</p><p>A natural shapeshifter (a lycanthrope, doppelganger, experienced druid, etc.) can take its natural form as a standard action.\n</p>\n<hr/>\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n"
