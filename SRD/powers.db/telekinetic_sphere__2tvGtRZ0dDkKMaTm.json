If the manifester ceases concentrating, the sphere does not move that round (if on a level surface) or descends at its falling rate (if aloft) until it reaches a level surface, the power's duration ends, or the manifester begins concentrating again. Because of the reduced weight, the sphere falls at a rate of only 60 feet per round, which is not fast enough to cause damage to its contents. If the manifester ceases concentrating (voluntarily or due to failing a Concentration check), he or she can resume concentrating on his or her next turn or any later turn during the power's duration. The manifester can move the sphere telekinetically even if he or she is in it.\n</p><p>Note that even if more than 5,000 pounds of weight is englobed, the perceived weight is only one-sixteenth of the actual weight, so the sphere can be rolled without exceptional effort.\n</p>\n<hr/>\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n"
