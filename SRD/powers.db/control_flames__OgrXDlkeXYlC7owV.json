A nonmagical fire source can be controlled if its bed or base is equal to or less than 1 square foot/level; larger fires cannot be controlled. The manifester can freely switch control between fire sources, or change the character of control, while maintaining concentration, but only one specified change can be made to one fire source in a round. When control over a fire source lapses, that fire immediately returns to its original state (or goes out if it has no fuel or has been moved beyond its original bed).\n</p><p>Increase/Decrease Flame: The manifester can increase a fire's size by up to 1 square foot/level. Each 1-square-foot expansion increases the potential damage the flames can deal by +1. The manifester can increase a fire's size beyond the original area, as long as it was equal to or smaller than the allowed size to begin with. The manifester can artificially keep a fire burning that would normally expire for lack of fuel, but dousing a controlled fire in sufficient water still puts it out.\n</p><p>The manifester can decrease the intensity of a flame by 1 square foot/level. Each such decrease in flame intensity causes a 1 reduction to its damage potential (to a minimum of 1 point). Reducing a fire's size to zero extinguishes it permanently.\n</p><p>Animate Fire: The manifester can make a fire move as if a living creature. An animated fire moves with a speed of 30 feet. It can have a crude humanoid or crude shape (or something more artistic, with an appropriate Craft [sculpting] check against a DC set by the GM), as long as the fire's overall volume does not exceed its original volume. A fire that moves away from its fuel or its original bed dies as soon as control over it lapses. The animated fire can attack a target, using the controller's base attack bonus to deliver touch attacks. A successful attack has a chance to set the foe on fire (the foe must roll a Reflex save [DC 15] to avoid this). Normally the victim is allowed a Reflex save each round to put out the flames; otherwise the fire burns for another 1d6 points of damage. Additional hits by the animated fire mean additional chances of ignition. The damage from multiple normal fires stacks, but the victim gets a saving throw each round to negate each fire. It is possible to switch control from the animated fire to intensify flames that are already burning (thus denying the foe Reflex saves after the first).\n</p>\n<hr/>\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n"
