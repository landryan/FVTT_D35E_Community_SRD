It can&rsquo;t take any other actions. In addition, the creature takes a -2 penalty on all saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks. If cornered, a panicked creature cowers. A panicked creature can use special abilities, including spells, to flee; indeed, the creature must use such means if they are the only way to escape.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Panicked is a more extreme state of fear than shaken or frightened.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
