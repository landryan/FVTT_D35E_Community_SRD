	"content": "<p>A helpless character is paralyzed, held, bound, sleeping, unconscious, or otherwise completely at an opponent&rsquo;s mercy. A helpless target is treated as having a Dexterity of 0 (-5 modifier). Melee attacks against a helpless target get a +4 bonus (equivalent to attacking a prone target). Ranged attacks gets no special bonus against helpless targets. Rogues can sneak attack helpless targets.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As a full-round action, an enemy can use a melee weapon to deliver a coup de grace to a helpless foe. An enemy can also use a bow or crossbow, provided he is adjacent to the target. The attacker automatically hits and scores a critical hit. (A rogue also gets her sneak attack damage bonus against a helpless foe when delivering a coup de grace.) If the defender survives, he must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + damage dealt) or die.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Delivering a coup de grace provokes attacks of opportunity.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Creatures that are immune to critical hits do not take critical damage, nor do they need to make Fortitude saves to avoid being killed by a coup de grace.</p>",
