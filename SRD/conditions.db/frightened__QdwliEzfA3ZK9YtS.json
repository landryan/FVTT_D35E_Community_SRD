A frightened creature takes a -2 penalty on all attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks. A frightened creature can use special abilities, including spells, to flee; indeed, the creature must use such means if they are the only way to escape.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Frightened is like shaken, except that the creature must flee if possible. Panicked is a more extreme state of fear.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
