Ever just one step ahead of danger, rogues bank on their cunning, skill, and charm to bend fate to their favor. Never knowing what to expect, they prepare for everything, becoming masters of a wide variety of skills, training themselves to be adept manipulators, agile acrobats, shadowy stalkers, or masters of any of dozens of other professions or talents. Thieves and gamblers, fast talkers and diplomats, bandits and bounty hunters, and explorers and investigators all might be considered rogues, as well as countless other professions that rely upon wits, prowess, or luck. Although many rogues favor cities and the innumerable opportunities of civilization, some embrace lives on the road, journeying far, meeting exotic people, and facing fantastic danger in pursuit of equally fantastic riches. In the end, any who desire to shape their fates and live life on their own terms might come to be called rogues.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Alignment:</strong> Any.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Hit Die:</strong> d6.</p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\">Class Skills</h2>\n<p class=\"p1\">The rogue’s class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Appraise (Int), Balance (Dex), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Decipher Script (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Int), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Forgery (Int), Gather Information (Cha), Hide (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Jump (Str), Knowledge (local) (Int), Listen (Wis), Move Silently (Dex), Open Lock (Dex), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Search (Int), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spot (Wis), Swim (Str), Tumble (Dex), Use Magic Device (Cha), and Use Rope (Dex).</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Skill Points at 1st Level:</strong> (8 + Int modifier) x 4.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Skill Points at Each Additional Level:</strong> 8 + Int modifier.</p>\n<p><br><span style=\"font-size: 13px; opacity: 0.8;\">Some description after&nbsp; Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook. © 2009, Paizo Publishing, LLC; Author: Jason Bulmahn, based on material by Jonathan Tweet, Monte Cook, and Skip Williams.

			"value": "<h2>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</h2>\n<p>Rogues are proficient with all&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons#simple-martial-and-exotic-weapons\">simple weapons</a>, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, shortbow, and short sword. They are proficient with light&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus\">armor</a>, but not with shields.</p>\n<h2>Sneak Attack</h2>\n<p>If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.</p>\n<p>The rogue’s attack deals extra damage anytime her target would be denied a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-\">Dexterity</a>&nbsp;bonus to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Armor-Class\">AC</a>&nbsp;(whether the target actually has a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-\">Dexterity</a>&nbsp;bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every two rogue levels thereafter. Should the rogue score a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#critical-hits\">critical hit</a>&nbsp;with a sneak attack, this extra damage is not multiplied. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet.</p>\n<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (like a sap, whip, or an unarmed strike), a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack, not even with the usual –4 penalty.</p>\n<p>The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with concealment.</p>\n<h2>Trapfinding</h2>\n<p>A rogue adds 1/2 her level to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perception\">Perception</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills#skill-checks\">skill checks</a>&nbsp;made to locate traps and to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/disable-device\">Disable Device</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills#skill-checks\">skill checks</a>&nbsp;(minimum +1). A rogue can use&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/disable-device\">Disable Device</a>&nbsp;to disarm magic traps.</p>\n<h2>Evasion (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and higher, a rogue can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she makes a successful&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex\">Reflex</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#saving-throws\">saving throw</a>&nbsp;against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#helpless\">helpless</a>&nbsp;rogue does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>\n<h2>Rogue Talents</h2>\n<p>As a rogue gains experience, she learns a number of talents that aid her and confound her foes. Starting at 2nd level, a rogue gains one rogue talent. She gains an additional rogue talent for every 2 levels of rogue attained after 2nd level. A rogue cannot select an individual talent more than once.</p>\n<p>Talents marked with an asterisk add effects to a rogue’s sneak attack. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual attack and the decision must be made before the attack roll is made.</p>\n<p>A rogue cannot choose a ninja trick with the same name as a rogue talent.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A complete listing of rogue talents can be found here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue/rogue-talents/\">Rogue Talents</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Trap Sense (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 3rd level, a rogue gains an intuitive sense that alerts her to danger from traps, giving her a +1 bonus on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex\">Reflex saves</a>&nbsp;made to avoid traps and a +1&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#dodge-bonuses\">dodge bonus</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Armor-Class\">AC</a>&nbsp;against attacks made by traps. These bonuses rise to +2 when the rogue reaches 6th level, to +3 when she reaches 9th level, to +4 when she reaches 12th level, to +5 at 15th, and to +6 at 18th level. Trap sense bonuses gained from multiple classes stack.</p>\n<h2>Uncanny Dodge (Ex)</h2>\n<p>Starting at 4th level, a rogue can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Flat-Footed\">flat-footed</a>, nor does she lose her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-\">Dex</a>&nbsp;bonus to AC if the attacker is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#invisible\">invisible</a>. She still loses her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-\">Dexterity</a>&nbsp;bonus to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Armor-Class\">AC</a>&nbsp;if immobilized. A rogue with this ability can still lose her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-\">Dexterity</a>&nbsp;bonus to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Armor-Class\">AC</a>&nbsp;if an opponent successfully uses the feint action (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat\">Combat</a>) against her.</p>\n<p>If a rogue already has uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>\n<h2>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex)</h2>\n<p>A rogue of 8th level or higher can no longer be flanked.</p>\n<p>This defense denies another rogue the ability to sneak attack the character by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target does.</p>\n<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</p>\n<h2>Advanced Talents</h2>\n<p>At 10th level, and every two levels thereafter, a rogue can choose one of the following advanced talents in place of a rogue talent.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A complete listing of advanced rogue talents can be found here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue/rogue-talents/#TABLE-Rogue-Adv-Talents\">Rogue Advanced Talents</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Master Strike (Ex)</h2>\n<p>Upon reaching 20th level, a rogue becomes incredibly deadly when dealing sneak attack damage. Each time the rogue deals sneak attack damage, she can choose one of the following three effects:</p>\n<p>The target can be…</p>\n<ul>\n<li>put to sleep for 1d4 hours</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Paralyzed\">paralyzed</a>&nbsp;for 2d6 rounds, or</li>\n<li>slain</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Regardless of the effect chosen, the target receives a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#fortitude\">Fortitude</a>&nbsp;save to negate the additional effect. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue’s level + the rogue’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-\">Intelligence</a>&nbsp;modifier. Once a creature has been the target of a master strike, regardless of whether or not the save is made, that creature is immune to that rogue’s master strike for 24 hours. Creatures that are immune to sneak attack damage are also immune to this ability.</p>"
