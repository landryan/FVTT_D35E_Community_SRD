While mages and sorcerers draw their might from the arcane structure of the world by complex incantations and clerics ask gods for powers, those whose minds are above others bend reality just by pure power of their thoughts. They fear nothing because they know that even when enemies break their swords, bind their hands, and gag their mouths, they cannot shut their minds. And this is all they need.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Alignment:</strong>&nbsp;Any.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Hit Die:</strong>&nbsp;d4.</p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\">Class Skills</h2>\n<p class=\"p1\">The psion’s class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Knowledge (all skills, taken individually) (Int), Profession (Wis), and Psicraft (Int).

His base daily allotment of power points is given on Table: The Psion. In addition, he receives bonus power points per day if he has a high Intelligence score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Power Points). His race may also provide bonus power points per day, as may certain feats and items.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Discipline:&nbsp;</strong>Every psion must decide at 1st level which psionic discipline he will specialize in. Choosing a discipline provides a psion with access to the class skills associated with that discipline (see above), as well as the powers restricted to that discipline. However, choosing a discipline also means that the psion cannot learn powers that are restricted to other disciplines. He can’t even use such powers by employing psionic items.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">You can read more about disciplines here: <a class=\"entity-link\" data-pack=\"D35E.srd-rules\" data-id=\"4rjyuBOPSmTjaiG2\" draggable=\"true\"><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i> Psionic Disciplines</a></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Powers Known:</strong>&nbsp;A psion begins play knowing three psion powers of your choice. Each time he achieves a new level, he unlocks the knowledge of new powers.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Choose the powers known from the psion power list, or from the list of powers of your chosen discipline. You cannot choose powers from disciplines other than your chosen discipline. (<em>Exception:&nbsp;</em>The feats Expanded Knowledge and Epic Expanded Knowledge do allow a psion to learn powers from the lists of other disciplines or even other classes.) A psion can manifest any power that has a power point cost equal to or lower than his manifester level.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The number of times a psion can manifest powers in a day is limited only by his daily power points.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">A psion simply knows his powers; they are ingrained in his mind. He does not need to prepare them (in the way that some spellcasters prepare their spells), though he must get a good night’s sleep each day to regain all his spent power points.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The Difficulty Class for saving throws against psion powers is 10 + the power’s level + the psion’s Intelligence modifier.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Maximum Power Level Known:</strong>&nbsp;A psion begins play with the ability to learn 1st-level powers. As he attains higher levels, a psion may gain the ability to master more complex powers.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To learn or manifest a power, a psion must have an Intelligence score of at least 10 + the power’s level.</p>",
